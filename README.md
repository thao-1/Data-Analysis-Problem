# Data-Analysis-Problem

This part of the assignment asks you to analyze a Linear Regression data set.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Exploratory analysis for regression**
- **Carry out OLS regression model**
- **Evaluate model**

## Question

For the data set in `Assignment_linear_regression_data.xlsx`, compare it with your own data set.

1. **Create a scatter plot** and visually decide if a linear model is appropriate. *(Hint: a matrix scatter plot will be most efficient).*

2. **Conduct Exploratory Analysis for Regression**
   - Try scatter plots and histograms.
   - Transform the data if it is not linear.

3. **Create an OLS Model** for the original data.

4. **Evaluate if the OLS Assumptions are Met**
   - Check for normality of errors centered around zero, equal variance, etc., for both the original and transformed data if appropriate.

5. **Outlier Analysis**
   - If datasets have outliers, remove them and observe the effect on the model (slope, intercept, and R-square).

## Output Requirements

- **OLS Full Report** for the original data set and transformed dataset, if appropriate.
- **Commentary** on the validity of the linear assumptions for the original and transformed data sets when appropriate.
- **Interpretation of the Slope and Intercept** in relation to the original data.
  - If the model is linear, the intercept value is the expected value when the independent variable is zero.
  - If the model is not linear, transform the equation back to its original form.

## Report

Write a report summarizing your findings.
